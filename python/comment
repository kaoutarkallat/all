the name of the list plus the index
asterisk : star
lists are mutable we can change them for exemple we can change the first element as follows
we can convert a string to a list using splits For example, 
the method split translates every group of characters separated by a space into an element in a list:
In Python, there are different data types: string, integer, and float. These data types can all be contained in a tuple as follows:
a dictionary consists of keys and values. it's helpful to compare a dictionary to a list 
list : index and element
dictionary: key, values
Keys can also be any immutable object such as a tuple:
Each key is separated from its value by a colon ":
". Commas separate the items, and the whole dictionary is enclosed in curly braces.

An empty dictionary without any items is written with just two curly braces, like this "{}".
A set is a unique collection of objects in Python. You can denote a set with a pair of curly brackets {}. Python will automatically remove duplicate items:
Remember that with sets you can check the difference between sets, as well as the symmetric difference, intersection, and union:
As both sets contain <b>AC/DC</b> and <b>Back in Black</b> we represent these common elements with the intersection of two circles.
The issubset() method returns True if all items in the set exists in the specified set, otherwise it retuns False.
The issuperset() method returns True if a set has every elements of another set (passed as an argument). If not, it returns False. Set X is said to be the superset of set Y if all elements of Y are in X .

equal: ==
not equal: !=
greater than: >
less than: <
greater than or equal to: >=
less than or equal to: <=
Logical operators
Sometimes you want to check more than one condition at once. For example, you might want to check if one condition and another condition are both True. Logical operators allow you to combine or modify conditions

The and statement is only True when both conditions are true. The or statement is True if one condition, or both are True. The not statement outputs the opposite truth value.

i'm tired as fuck

A variable that is declared inside a function is called a local variable
A variable that is declared outside a function definition is a global variable, and its value is accessible and modifiable throughout the program.

list.remove()
delt list[]

object oriented programming

li[1:3]   # Return list from index 1 to 3 => [2, 4]
li[2:]    # Return list starting from index 2 => [4, 3]
li[:3]    # Return list from beginning until index 3  => [1, 2, 4]
li[::2]   # Return list selecting every second entry => [1, 4]
li[::-1]  # Return list in reverse order => [3, 4, 2, 1]

del by index 
remove by element
